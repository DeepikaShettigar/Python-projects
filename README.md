game is 30 seconds. Colors used in this game are Red, Blue, Green, Pink, Black, Yellow, Orange, White, Purple and Brown. Interface will display 
name of different colors in different colors. Player has to identify the color and enter the correct color name to win the game.

### Dam.py
A dam reservoir's capacity is 250e100 cubic meter where it holds 199.5e85 cu.m water. A rain occurred in the area which gave 25e8 cu.m water but 
25% amount of this rain water ran-off useless. The remaining water from this rainfall flowed to the reservoir and there it was collected. 
On another day, a heavy storm increased the water level of this dam to its 15% of the current water level. Ground water sources contributed 
5% to reservoir's current level. 5% of the present level of reservoir evaporated and later 15% amount of water was passed for irrigation to arid regions.
Write a python program using less number of lines of code to find the current water level of the reservoir using the given data?

### Diamond.py
Get an input from the user and generate pattern in the order as that can be referred below:

### encryption.py
You might have heard about Cyptography, haven't you? 
Sending confidential messages with clean encoding and decoding.
It has great importance especially in cyber intelligence as well as defence ministry. There are many kinds of encyphering techniques prevailing now. 
 Have you hear about Caesar's encypher?
This is an ancient and simple encypher method. 
 Look at this encoded message  : L ORYH BRX 
When decoded, it looks this way : I LOVE YOU 
Wondering how?
In the previous encoding we used an alphabet right shift of 3. 
It means every alphabet will be considered with third corresponding alphabet when encoded. 
Finally we will have,
Shift value: 3 
Actual     : A B C D E F G ...... U V W X Y Z 
Encoded : C D E F G H I ........ X Y Z A B C 

### logging.py
A receptionist has the duty of noting the details of visitors walking-in to the office. She notes in the register their name, phone number, 
place coming from and body temperature. In a view to change this pen-paper task to a computer task, use your python programming skills to make a 
solution for this operation.
The program should be able to gather the four inputs mentioned earlier. Besides, a database/text file should be created in the local 
device (computer) with this data. Bring out the best solution! When there are no more entries, any solution as per programmer's choice may be 
used to terminate the execution of the program.
Note:
1. Use of any suitable data structure is entertained
2. Concepts discussed during 'File Handling' may help to create file in machine with current date-time as file name

### pyramid.py
